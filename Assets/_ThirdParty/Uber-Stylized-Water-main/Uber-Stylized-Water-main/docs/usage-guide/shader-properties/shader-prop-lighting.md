### **Specular Highlights**

1. **Specular Color**  
   Controls the color of the specular highlights on the water surface. However. this overwrites any light color.
   Specular brightness can be adjusted from the HDR intensity slider. With high value you can create fantasy like sparking water. Or make it zero to remove specular highlights.

2. **Specular Spread**

   - Diffuses the specular highlight across the water's surface.
   - A value of **0** gives a focused highlight.
   - Higher values result in softer, broader highlights.

3. **Specular Hardness**

   - Blends between soft and hard specular highlight edges.

4. **Specular Size**

   - Functions only when **Specular Hardness** is greater than **0**.
   - Controls the size of the hard highlight.

5. **Specular Distortion**
   - The specular distortion is affected by the [Normal map](usage-guide/shader-properties/shader-prop-normal.md) strength.
