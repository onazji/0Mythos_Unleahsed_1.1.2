#### Edge Smoothing:

Using a blurry foam map, we can control the thickness of the foam using this settings.

- **SurfFoam_Edge**: Controls the thickness of the foam edges.
- **SurfFoam_EdgeSmooth**: Controls the edge smoothness. A subtle value will help to minimize jagged edges.

### 2. Surface Distortion

- A texture is required in the `SurfaceDistortion_Map` slot for this effect to work.
- This texture is used to distort the surface foam, adding extra motion to the water surface.
