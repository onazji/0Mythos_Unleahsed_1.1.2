## Import the asset

There are two ways to import the asset:

1. Download the reposetory as a zip file.

   - Copy the `Assets/Shaders/Uber Stylized Water/ folder` to your project.

2. Get the latest unity package from [release](https://github.com/MatrixRex/Uber-Stylized-Water/releases) page.

   - Import the package.

### Configure the URP Asset

Use the pre-configured Renderer Asset included in the `Demo/Settings` folder.

Or Modify your URP Renderer Asset to support the shader:

1. Open your Renderer Asset.

## Adding the Shader to Your Own Scene

There are three ways to use the shader in your custom scenes:

### 1. Use Template Prefabs

- Drag and drop water prefabs from the `Prefabs/Water Templates` folder into your scene.

### 2. Apply Preset Materials

- Select any water preset material from the `Uber Stylized Water/Template Materials` folder.
- Assign it to your existing meshes.

### 3. Create Your Own Material

- Create a new Material in Unity.
- Assign the **UberStylizedWater** shader to your material.
